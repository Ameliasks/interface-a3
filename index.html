        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This assignment is a chance to not only show off your final UI, but to
          reflect on the process of its production. This involves a written
          component (supported by other types of information) where you'll need
          to cover 6 different points. As the assessment criteria notes, this
          should be a detailed discussion (telling me what you did) and a
          meaningful reflection (was that thing successful? what did I learn
          from it?).
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-reflection and self-criticality are important skills as a
          designer in any medium, and the written reflection is not only a
          chance to highlight the things you did well, but to look at the parts
          that you think could have been approached in a different manner. When
          I assess reflections, I value an honest discussion of the process, and
          am looking for an engagement with your own perspective of what
          occurred as you were building your UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there's no word limit or suggestion on the written component,
          there are 6 different points you are required to highlight. They are a
          separated list, and I'll briefly touch on each below, however your
          reflection doesn't need to be formatted as a paragraph on each. While
          it may be good to use the keywords (values, feedback, learnability
          etc) to signal their discussion in your writing, these different
          points should relate to each other, your UIs concept, and the way it
          responds to the creative prompt and advanced technique. As such
          integrating them together within the structure of your reflection will
          typically make sense.
        </p>
        <div class="dotted-line "></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your design's guiding values and how they were embodied in the UI.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We looked at design values back in week 5, discussing some common
          values that get deployed in Interaction Design. Here I'm looking for
          you to speak to a couple of values (2 or 3 is fine) and how they
          practically influenced your design. So if you were to discuss
          immersion, going beyond stating that your UI was intended to be
          immersive, and connecting it to the specific aspects of your UI's
          appearance and behaviour that are intended to create immersion. You
          can reference the values we discussed in week 5, but you can also
          instead speak to your own set of values, as long as you're making the
          connection between them and your UI's design.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your rationale in designing your UI's feedback, information design,
            mapping and learnability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tying back to what we covered at the start of semester, you should
          discuss and reflect upon how each of these concepts are deployed
          within your design. This doesn't mean covering each single aspect of
          information design, for example, in your UI, but highlighting one or
          two specific cases as a manner of discussing a broader approach. This
          approach might directly connect to your values, or to other of the
          core concepts, or even technical and production restrictions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any significant changes since your work in progress milestone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You need to reflect upon any changes since the prototype and concept
          presentation (which you did as your progress milestone), speaking to
          not only what changed, but why it changed, and perhaps if that change
          was successful.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your navigation of the production timeline and how you spent your
            development time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You need to address the process of producing your UI along with its
          final outcome. This could involve a specific timeline, particular
          moments of inflection, or speaking to areas where you spent more/less
          time than you thought you would. In reflecting on this you might for
          example look at your plans versus what happened, where those things
          aligned, where they diverged, and what this taught you about scoping
          and delivering self directed projects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The design aspect that you are most proud of.</li>
          <li>The design aspect you found most challenging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The final two are different sides of the same coin. I've specifically
          avoided using positive/negative wording, and focused on your
          perspective, versus what you think others might perceive in your final
          UI. Maybe you're most proud of an underlying JS function that no user
          will ever see, or you found making your characterisation cohesive the
          most challenging, even if you think it was ultimately successful.
        </p>

          Remember that this will be a document of your project, so try to write
          and answer these topics in a way that communicates in detail your
          intentions and how they were put into practice.

        <h3>Submission Format</h3>
        <p>
          Like the previous two assignments this submission will be a small web
          page - this should be separate to your UI, and contain the required
          written reflection and links. Use this format to your advantage - you
          don't have to make it complex, but remember you are able to use
          embedded links, images and videos as part of communicating your
          reflection. This includes the required links - for example you need to
          reflect on significant changes between your
          <a href="https://tiny-lokum-10e3ee.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
            prototype
          </a>
          and
          <a
            href="https://lustrous-hamster-391a07.netlify.app/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            finished UI
          </a>
          , and you are able to point to them directly to support your
          discussion. Or you could link to a specific code file in your repo
          with a line reference, as a way to support your rationale for
          designing the UI's mapping.
